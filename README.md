Welcome to The Star Wars Codex!

This is a wiki-esque site that contains a plethora of information about the first 6 Star Wars movies. Here, you may learn more detailed informations about the films, characters, species, planets, starships, and vehicles that have all been featured at some point in the movies. You may also sort these items to see interesting information like all the characters from shortest to tallest, starships from cheapest to most expensive, and many more options.
